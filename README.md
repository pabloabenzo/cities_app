# cities_app

In this Readme file I'm going to explain what methods and solutions I used into the project. I decided to use a method which recharge the list while the user is scrolling down in the view, for avoid unnecessary memory use. Also I have adapted the search logic into it. For data persistence I chose keep it in UserDefaults for this challenge, but for a bigger and real project I would choose Core Data or Swift Data for data persistence. I liked MVVM as architecture for the project (I would use Viper for giant apps with modules, for example), and XCTest for Unit Test over Swift Testing. I used SwiftUI for the views.
